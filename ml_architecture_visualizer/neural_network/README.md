## Aesthetically pleasing NN vector drawing

This is inspired by https://github.com/HarisIqbal88/PlotNeuralNet

I have found the project to be useful, however, it is not very flexible as it lacks features to incorporate out-of-the-box architecture drawing.

In order to resolve this, I am writing my own version of PlotNeuralNetwork, reusing the already available code wherever possible.

### What can be expected
Great documentation to tweak the little details to suit your needs.
