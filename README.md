# Visualization-techniques
This repository contains an extensive set of re-usable code snippets for visualizing *all* kinds of data and several machine learning models. The code base relies on matplotlib and snsplot for producing high quality publishable figures. For interactive visualizations, I use plotly package. The motivation is to keep code snippets that I can re-use whenever possible.

**Note: I don't update this repo very often**
